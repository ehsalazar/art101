			<h1>Hi, fren!</h1>
			<p>I'd like to welcome you to this humble site. It's a digital home where I'll refamiliarise myself with some of the basic building blocks of computer programing. Through this site, and the ART 101 labs linked below, I'll be working through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. <br><br>
			Although I've not had official Computer Science or Graphic Design training, I expect the bones and dressing of this site will evolve (<i>and hopefully improve</i>) over time. I invite you to come along on this journey. <br><br>
		  A quick word on art. The images that colorfully back each page's title are photographs I've taken on my travels. They highlight my appreciation and love of street art. <br><br>
			This page's photograph was captured in the Oost neighborhood in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Subsequent photo details can be found in each page's footer.</p>
